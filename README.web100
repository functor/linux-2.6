The Web100 patch (linux-2.6-690-web100.patch) is based on the patch here:

http://www.web100.org/download/kernel/2.5.27/web100-2.5.27-201001301335.tar.gz

A number of hunks did not apply cleanly against our patched PlanetLab
kernel.  I tried to manually resolve these conflicts.  Additionally,
some of the networking code looks to have been refactored, and so a
couple of hunks that applied cleanly to tcp_ipv[46].c caused
compile-time errors/warnings.  I fixed these as best I could.
