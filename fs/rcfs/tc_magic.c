/*****************************************************************************
 * Taskclass general
 *
 * Define structures for taskclass root directory and its magic files 
 * In taskclasses, there is one set of magic files, created automatically under
 * the taskclass root (upon classtype registration) and each directory (class) 
 * created subsequently. However, classtypes can also choose to have different 
 * sets of magic files created under their root and other directories under 
 * root using their mkdir function. RCFS only provides helper functions for 
 * creating the root directory and its magic files
