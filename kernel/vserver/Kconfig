config	VSERVER_LEGACY
	bool	"Enable Legacy Kernel API"
	default y
	help
	  This enables the legacy API used in vs1.xx, which allows
	  to use older tools (for migration purposes).

config	VSERVER_PROC_SECURE
	bool	"Enable Proc Security"
	depends on PROC_FS
	default y
	help
	  Hide proc entries by default for xid>1

config	VSERVER_HARDCPU
	bool	"Enable Hard CPU Limits"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	default n
	help
	  Activate the Hard CPU Limits

choice
	prompt	"Persistent Inode Context Tagging"
	default	INOXID_UGID24
	help
	  This adds persistent context information to filesystems
	  mounted with the tagxid option. Tagging is a requirement
	  for per context disk limits and per context quota.


config	INOXID_NONE
	bool	"Disabled"
	help
	  no context information is store for inodes

config	INOXID_UID16
	bool	"UID16/GID32"
	help
	  reduces UID to 16 bit, but leaves GID at 32 bit.

config	INOXID_GID16
	bool	"UID32/GID16"
	help
	  reduces GID to 16 bit, but leaves UID at 32 bit.

config	INOXID_UGID24
	bool	"UID24/GID24"
	help
	  uses the upper 8bit from UID and GID for XID tagging
	  which leaves 24bit for UID/GID each, which should be
	  more than sufficient for normal use.

config	INOXID_INTERN
	bool	"UID32/GID32"
	help
	  this uses otherwise reserved inode fields in the on
	  disk representation, which limits the use to a few
	  filesystems (currently ext2 and ext3)

config	INOXID_RUNTIME
	bool	"Runtime"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  inodes are tagged when first accessed, this doesn't
	  require any persistant information, but might give
	  funny results for mixed access.

endchoice

config	VSERVER_DEBUG
	bool	"Compile Debugging Code"
	default n
	help
	  Set this to yes if you want to be able to activate
	  debugging output at runtime. It adds a probably small
	  overhead (~ ??%) to all vserver related functions and
	  increases the kernel size by about 20k.
