This package provides a vserver-capable kernel for plain fedora 12
boxes it should be rebuilt on a fedora 12 host

This package is *NOT* intended to be a basis for a PlanetLab nodes
kernel 

In a nutshell, we take the upstream kernel source rpm, and
sneak the plain vserver patch as an addition before the fedora patches
are applied; only a few of the fedora patches needed to be tweaked b/c
they were working on an area that the vserver patch had altered.

We use this, together with util-vserver that we rebuild as well, in order
to set up the planetlab build and test architecture.

FYI, a centos5.4 vserver box cannot easily create f11 or f12 vservers,
due to a disruptive change in rpm
