CRBCE
----------

crbce is a superset of rbce. In addition to providing automatic
classification, the crbce module
- monitors per-process delay data that is collected by the delay 
accounting patch
- collects data on significant kernel events where reclassification
could occur e.g. fork/exec/setuid/setgid etc., and
- uses relayfs to supply both these datapoints to userspace

To illustrate the utility of the data gathered by crbce, we provide a
userspace daemon called crbcedmn that prints the header info received
from the records sent by the crbce module.

0. Ensure that a CKRM-enabled kernel with following options configured
   has been compiled. At a minimum, core, rcfs, atleast one classtype,
   delay-accounting patch and relayfs. For testing, it is recommended
   all classtypes and resource controllers be compiled as modules.

1. Ensure that the Makefile's BUILD_CRBCE=1 and KDIR points to the
   kernel of step 1 and call make.
   This also builds the userspace daemon, crbcedmn.

2..9 Same as rbce installation and testing instructions, 
     except replacing rbce.ko with crbce.ko

10. Read the pseudo daemon help file
    # ./crbcedmn -h

11. Run the crbcedmn to display all records being processed
    # ./crbcedmn
